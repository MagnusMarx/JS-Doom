aight so this isn't supposed to work right as you download it. but it might.


TO PLAY WITHOUT INTERNET ACESS:

aight so this isn't supposed to work right as you download it. but it might.


PREP-ING ZIP FOLDER:

============================================================================================

You need to get the .zip dos roms for these games.
once you get the roms, make sure the files are not in a folder
the structure should be === "example.zip">files
NOT LIKE THIS ==== "example.zip">folder>files
if you have the file structure, good for you, place the .zip archive into the corresponding folder
so "doom.zip" should go in the doom folder
"doom2.zip" goes into the doom 2 folder

============================================================================================

SETTING UP THE GAME:

============================================================================================

HAVE NOTEPAD++ READY

heres what you need to do, ill tell you using doom as an example

you have your .zip archive ready for use and it is in the doom folder

open the "index.html" with notepad++ or whatever software like it and open the doom.zip archive you have

go down to line 31, or where ever it says "dosbox.run("https://magnusmarx.github.io/Doom.zip", "./DOOM.EXE");"

make sure that the .exe file in your archive is named exactly DOOM.EXE or whatever comes before the.exe extension.

to make this easy for you, here is what all the games exe files should be names

============================================================================================

FILE EXTENSIONS:

============================================================================================

doom should be DOOM.EXE
doom 2 should be DOOM2.EXE
heretic should be heretic.exe
hexen should be HEXEN.EXE
plutonia should be DOOM2.EXE
TNT should be DOOM2.EXE
wolf3d should be WOLF3D.EXE

============================================================================================


IF YOU ARE LAZY AND DON'T WANNA GET A COPY OF THE GAME:

============================================================================================

notice how i left out strife, ill get to that later

on line 31, there should be a link that goes to a zip file. IF YOU WANT, go ahead and download those zip files
there wont be any virus and if there is, i dont know what to tell you

============================================================================================


RUNNING STRIFE:

============================================================================================

k now we have strife
do not download the link in the strife index folder,
it's not a complete build of strife and won't work if you try to download it and use it

so, get yourself a good copy of strife and prep the zip file like I told you how to

the name for strife should be STRIFE1.EXE

============================================================================================

RUNNING THE GAMES:

============================================================================================

click on the index.html file that isn't in any specific folder
click the button to the game you want to play, and there you go
have fun playing doom, doom 2, heretic, hexen, plutonia, tnt, strife, and wolf3D in JS/HTML5

============================================================================================


just so you know, this was made by a 15 year old. so HAH, take that.

idk how that was supposed to make you feel bad, but it somehow did

============================================================================================



Best,
